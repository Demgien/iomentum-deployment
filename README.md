Donow's repository

This repo contains a server configuration (NginX) deployment with an Ansible playbook.
We used a docker container test, EC2 AWS instance for remote server and GitHub Secrets to hide SSH private key.

This automatisation helps you to deploy your webserver configuration easily by choosing your variables in 'vars_conf.yml'.
